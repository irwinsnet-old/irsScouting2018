    "# ISP01 - Installation and Setup of IRS Scouting System\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS, FRC 1318) maintains a custom-built scouting system consisting of android tablets that run a scouting app for data entry and a server that runs on a laptop. This document explains how to download, install, and configure all of the software that is required to develop, maintain and run the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scouting System Software Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Custom android application, written in Java\n",
    "* Custom Server application, written in Python\n",
    "* Postgresql, an open source database server\n",
    "* Anaconda Python 3 eistribution, which provides the following packages:\n",
    "    * psycopg2 and sqlalchemy, Python packages for connecting to Postgresql databases\n",
    "    * pandas, a Python package for data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "    * cherrypy, a Python package that includes an HTTP server\n",
    "* Java Software Development Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java Software Development Kit\n",
    "* IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java\n",
    "* Pycharm IDE for Python\n",
    "* Git and Github for version control\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks (this document was written in a Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "* pgAdmin database administration tool for Postgresql\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these tools are available via internet download for free. These instructions assume the software is running on the Windows 10 operating system. All software is also available for and should work on Mac and Linux, but we have not tested that configuration.\n"

    "## 2. Using the Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Many software development tools must be run in the Windows command prompt. Here are a few configuration steps that make the commadn prompt easier to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a command prompt shortcut on your destop.\n",
    "    1. Find the *Command Prompt* icon under *Windows System* folder within the *All Programs* portion of your the start menu.\n",
    "    2. Drag the *Command Prompt* icon to the desktop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Edit the command prompt properties.\n",
    "    1. Right click on the newly created command prompt desktop icon and select *Properties*.\n",
    "    2. Put the desired starting folder in the *Start In:* box on the *Shortcut* tab. For example, my starting location for working on scouting is \"C:\\Users\\stacy\\OneDrive\\Projects\\irsScouting2018\". \n",
    "    3. Play with the settings on the other tabs. You can change colors, fonts, font sizes, window sizes, etc. My command prompt for working on scouting looks like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "![Command Prompt](images/ISP01/cmd_prompt.png)\n",

    "## 3. Anaconda Python Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python stack is a customized version of Python that is relatively easy to use. In addition to Python, Anaconda provides a multitude of commonly used Python software packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and the Anaconda Python 3 stack from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Make sure you download the 64-bit Python 3 version (do not download the Python 2 version!).\n",
    "2. Run the Anaconda installer and select all default options during the installation process, including *Install for this user only.*\n",
    "3. Now verify that you can run anaconda commands at the command prompt. Open the new command prompt window that you created in section 2 and run the following command (make sure you type a capital 'V'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda -V\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    * You should see the Anaconda version number: ![Conda Check](images/ISP01/cmd_conda_v.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If instead you see something like `'conda' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` then we need to update the Windows `PATH` variable to tell Windows how to find the Anaconda program (skip ahead to section 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Anaconda provides a command line tool for managing Python packages, which is invoked by typing `conda` at the command prompt. Typing `conda -V` tells Anaconda to print out the version number. A very helpful command is `conda list`: ![Conda List Command](images/ISP01/cmd_conda_list.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The `conda list` command lists all Python packages that are currently installed. The screen shot above has been truncated -- by default Anaconda installs well over 100 packages and supports over 400 packages. See https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.6_win-64 for a complete list. Most of the packages we need for the scouting system, such as Pandas, are already installed. There are a few packages that are not installed by default, which we'll have to download.\n",
    "4. Run the following commands to install other required packages (hit 'Y' when prompted):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install psycopg2\n",
    "conda install cherrypy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other useful conda commands include `conda update` for updating packages and `conda -h` for displaying all available conda commends. To get detailed help on an individual command, type `conda [command_name] -h` (e.g., `conda update -h`).\n",

    "## 4. Updating Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses special Windows operating system settings called environment variables. We need to update a couple environment variables for Python to work properly.\n",
    "1. Type *environment* into the Windows search box on the task bar, then select the option *Edit the **Environment** variables for your account.*\n",
    "    * This will open a dialog box for editing environment variables. The upper box contains environment variables that apply only to the current logged-in account, and the bottom box lists environment variables that apply to all accounts on the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Don't touch the bottom box with the system variables. Select the `Path` variable in the upper box with the account variables, then click *Edit*.\n",
    "    * This displays a dialog box with a list of folder locations. The `Path` variable is important because when type the name of a program at the command prompt, Windows looks for the program in the current folder first (the folder location displayed in the command prompt) and then the folders listed in the `Path` variable. It doesn't matter if the program is on your computer and works fine -- if the program's location isn't listed in the `Path` variable, Windows will tell you it can't find the program. (There are a couple other ways to tell Windows where the program is located, but we'll discuss that later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the *Edit Environment Variables*, click *New* and then click *Browse*. Navigate to the folder that contains the `python.exe` file. If you accepted the default settings when installing Anaconda, this file should be at C:\\Users\\{your user account}\\Anaconda3. Select the Anaconda3 folder and click *OK*. Keep clicking *OK* until you've closed all of the dialog boxes that you just opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Editing Environment Variables](images/ISP01/env_var.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Command prompt windows load environment variables when they are first opened. If you have any command prompt windows that are open, you will need to close and reopen them to load the new environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Type `python -V` at the command prompt. You should see the version of python installed on your system. If you see an error instead, check your `Path` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Editing Environment Variables](images/ISP01/cmd_python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can check your environment variables at the command prompt. Try it: type `Set` at the command prompt. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Editing Environment Variables](images/ISP01/cmd_set.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "1. Environmental variables are case-insensitive. `Path`, `PATH`, `path`, and `pAtH` are all the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Reading:**\n",
    "1. Type `help set` at the command prompt."

    "## 5. Installing Postgresql\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ and download the Windows installer for Postgresql.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer. When asked for a password, enter `irs1318`. Otherwise select all default options.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. By default, Postgresql will run in the background all the time. You probably don't want a database server running all of the time on your computer sucking up resources. To change the default behavior:\n",
    "    1. Verify the location of your Postgresql data directory. Itâ€™s probably located in `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`.\n",
    "    2. Refer to section #4 and add an environment variable called PGDATA (it it doesn't already exist). The value of the environment variable will be the location of the Postgresql data directory (`C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data`) ![Edit PGDATA Variable](images/ISP01/env_pgdata.png)\n",
    "    3. While you have the environment variable dialogs open, add the location of the Postgresql *bin* folder to the `Path` variable for your account. It's probably at `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\bin`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Type \"Services\" into the task bar search box and select the *Services* desktop app. \n",
